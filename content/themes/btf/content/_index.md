BashTheFash Mission Statement: To connect antifascists wherever they may be and facilitate organization and creation of local activist groups.

Fascism NEEDS to met with equally hateful opposition. You're in the right place!

The goal of this community is to organize IRL quickly and effectively to combat fascism. We need numbers to do so. Please share the group, spread the word!! This is our main priority right now.

This isn't to say it's our only goal. Go out and protest locally, volunteer locally, spread awareness online, donate to human rights groups, make music and art. @everyone has skills they can contribute to the community. We all want to oppose fascism.

WE CAN DO THIS, but we need ALL of us!

"When Fascism came into power, most people were unprepared, both theoretically and practically. They were unable to believe that man could exhibit such propensities for evil, such lust for power, such disregard for the rights of the weak, or such yearning for submission. Only a few had been aware of the rumbling of the volcano preceding the outbreak."

-Erich Fromm, Escape From Freedom
