# Practicing Anarchism aka Praxxis

Anarchism isn’t just an idea; it’s about taking action and organizing our communities. Protests are a big part of this, but they come with risks. Here’s how to practice anarchism through protest and activism, and some essential safety tips to keep in mind.

- Direct Action: This means taking action to achieve a goal directly, without waiting for politicians. Examples include sit-ins, strikes, and blockades.

- Mutual Aid: Organize or join mutual aid networks to support your community directly. This can include sharing food, setting up free stores, or providing community health services.

- Autonomous Spaces: Create and maintain spaces that operate independently of the state, like squats, community gardens, and infoshops. These can be hubs for organizing and mutual aid.

- Spread The Word: Spread the word of revolution through actions that show how things could be different. This can include community projects, direct actions, and artistic expressions like graffiti and street art.

## Effective Protest Tactics

**Black Bloc:** Dress in black and wear masks to maintain anonymity and solidarity. This makes it harder for authorities to identify individuals and allows for collective action without fear of retribution.

**Sit-Ins:** Occupy a space to disrupt normal operations. Sit-ins can be powerful tools for highlighting injustice and demanding change.

**Sticker Graffiti**:** Cover up hate symbols, and piss of your local fasisct group through *sticker graffiti*, slap up stickers with messages encouraging civil disobedience, supporting human rights, and rightfully calling out harmful governments on their actions.

**Civil Disobedience:** Speaking of civil disobedience... Deliberately break unjust laws to highlight their injustice and provoke change. Refuse to leave protest sites, stick gum in your parking meter and leave a sticker telling why, feed people struggling to eat (Like Food Not Bombs), which is illegal in many places, plant edible plants in public spaces which can help provide to houseless comrades. 

## Safety Tips for Protesting

**TURN OFF YOUR CELLPHONE:** Make a plan, with scheduled check-ins, write useful phone numbers somewhere where you can access it. (On your body, on a piece of paper in your pocket etc.) Cellphones can be used to track your location and monitor your activities. If you need to bring a phone, use a burner phone and keep it turned off when not in use.

**KKNOW YOUR RIGHTS**: Learn about your legal rights as a protester. Know what you can and can’t do, and be ready to assert your rights if necessary.

**DDON'T TALK TO COPS:** Police are not your friends. Anything you say can be used against you or your comrades. If approached by law enforcement, exercise your right to remain silent and ask for a lawyer. ACAB includes all cops! YES, ALL COPS! They enforce and police for the 1%, the fascists, they are never going to be your friend.

**Dress Appropriately:** Wear comfortable clothing and sturdy shoes. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and a mask to protect your identity and health. Avoid wearing identifiable clothing or accessories, aka BLACK BLOC.

**Bring Supplies:** Carry water, snacks, and basic first aid supplies. If possible, bring a small backpack with extra clothing, a bandana, and any necessary medications. If possible, take street medicine or first aid classes!

**Stay Together:** Protest with a comrade or in a group. Look out for each other and have a plan for what to do if you get separated.

**Document Everything:** If it’s safe to do so, document police actions and any incidents of violence or misconduct. This can be crucial evidence if legal action is necessary.

Practicing anarchism through direct action and mutual aid, and taking necessary safety precautions during protests, helps us resist oppression and work toward a more just and equitable society. Our strength lies in our solidarity and our commitment to building a better world.
